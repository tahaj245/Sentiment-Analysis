# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed in text. It helps identify whether the sentiment behind a piece of text—such as a review, comment, tweet, or message—is positive, negative, or neutral.
It works by analyzing words, phrases, and context to detect feelings, opinions, or emotions. For example, the sentence “The movie was amazing” is positive, while “The service was terrible” is negative.
